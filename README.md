# discord-page-website
A basic website to show off your discord activities. For now it's using lanyard's api so you need to join their [discord server](https://discord.gg/lanyard) to get your discord status.(This is a kind of an experiment version, i fixed something but i'm nos so sure about it so if you want to you can just use v1.3)

# Roadmap
1. Badges
2. Fix small errors
