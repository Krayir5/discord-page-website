# discord-page-website
A basic website to show off your discord activities. For now it's using lanyard's api so you need to join their [discord server](https://discord.gg/lanyard) to get your discord status.(You need to change "your discord api" in api.js and stateapi.js with your discord api)
# Roadmap
1. Badges
2. Fix small errors
3. Update every second(prob this weekend)
